1. Open Wabbajack and start your installation
2. Wait for your first download button to appear
3. Press the spacebar and enjoy
4. if you must, press esc to stop only when you have successfully ran the script for a second, if it freezes just close it and open it again if you didn't finish
No future iterations will be available so dont try asking for help or giving me issues as I literally wrote this in 1 hour and just said f*** it its done.
You can press space to start only once you are on the screen which shows the download button! From there sit back get a nice warm cup of tea or joe and have fun playing {sometime in your actual lifespan} since this script will do all the work for you. Keep in mind if you try to run this script outside of wabbajack nexus window it wont work, and could potentially fail dont worry as nothing will break just close it and open it in the proper environment the next time.
